Pixel Smile
It turns out we’ve been given a program that was half implemented by a colleague. It’s supposed to create pixel art outputting a smiling face to the console, but there are many errors and it doesn’t work.

In this project, we’re going to leverage TypeScript’s type system to help us fix bugs and guide our work implementing the missing functions. At the end, we’ll have a smiling face outputting to the console and the opportunity to draw our own pictures.
